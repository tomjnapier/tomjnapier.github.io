I'm a web developer and accessibilty specialist. I'm currently working for the civil service in the UK. I'm trying to use this site to record my thoughts, you can find my <a href="/blog">articles on the blog</a>. If you like, you can <a href="/about">read more about me</a>, or if you have questions, you can <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
