It's just after 7pm on a Friday night, the lights are starting to dim and trailers for a pretty middling set of tent-pole features have just ended. They include Godzilla x Kong (which I still don't know how to pronounce), Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (by my count, the tenth in the silver-screen simian series).

A distinct lack of self discipline has left me poking around the very bottom of a bag of popcorn I hastily picked up from the supermarket on the way here. No snacks left and the movie hasn't even started.

That movie, by the way, is 1993's watershed blockbuster, *Jurassic Park*. I'm now settled in to watch a 90's classic at the cinema, and it's no coincidence that I've been thinking a lot about nostalgia lately. 

## Object permanence

This was the first time I've seen Jurassic Park at the cinema. It was showing as part of a Stephen Spielberg season at my local picture house. I was five years old when Jurassic Park was released and I've finally seen it on the big screen aged thirty-five.

For me, Jurassic Park has always been there. It came out when I was so young that I've never known there be no Jurassic Park. It existed regardless of whether I knew about it or not, and it was just, waiting for me to discover it.

## A link to the past

- On one level, nostalgia is as base as experiencing "oh yeah, I remember that".
- I don't think we like callbacks and nostalgia because of the actual content.
- I think we like nostalgia because it links us right back to that time where we were discovering, for the first time, things that came before we even existed.


## Who is this pandering to?
Fast forward a handful of months and I'm leaving the same picture house having watched Fede Alvarez's *Alien: Romulus*, (the ninth Alien movie). It was so nearly a good movie, but it fell apart with a particularly heinous, clumsy throwback to a franchise character. A plot device, implemented poorly, and presumably to satiate the nostalgic pangs of a fanbase who are in the minority.

## heading

I wonder that, eventually, with age, whilst some of us long to be taken back to those comforting times, others are desperate to experience something new, because we've seen this movie before and nothing will
