I like writing. I often think that I don't do it very much, but as with most jobs that aren't manual or vocational now, I spend a large part of my day writing emails. I try hard to write clearly and craft my email communications so they're clear for my colleagues; it is pretty draining though.

For a while now I've been wanting to write for enjoyment, not for work.
