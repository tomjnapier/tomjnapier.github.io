There's a concept in video game design called "game feel". It sounds a bit like "mouth-feel" which is gross, but nonetheless I've been thinking about it quite a bit recently.

Games like Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Hollow Knight or Celeste all have pretty well celebrated game feel and dynamics. It's unsurprising that those mentioned are all platformers in one way or other. I think platform games live or die by how they feel to move around the world.

But what about a game with a great game feel that's not a platformer, and certainly not 2D? Subnautica and it's more polished sequel Subnautica: Below Zero have, in my view, really good game feel, and I'm going to state my case.
