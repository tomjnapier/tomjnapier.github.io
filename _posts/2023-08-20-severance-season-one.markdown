I completely missed Severance on release, which I guess was during COVID (-ish, it was February 2022 apparently). A couple of things drew me to it recently. First was a breakdown of the CG intro titling, and second was a free trial for Apple TV+.

This also meant that I came to Severance with almost no-knowledge, ...

## Lumon Industries

Severance starts with Helly R's first day at the engimatic Lumon Industries (Helly is played by [Britt Lower](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3138882/)). It's a fairly rough onboarding. Helly has undergone the 'severance' procedure, whereby her memories are severed; during the day, whilst at work, she has no memory of her outside of work self (her 'outie'). Similarly, her outside of work self has no memory of her in-work self (her 'innie').

Helly's innie is extremely reluctant to submit to this state of affairs. She's emboldened in her dissent when her would-be captors - who are initially represented by a cold, distant voice from another room - are revealed to be other employees of Lumon, and they're about as in-the-dark as Helly is.

Severance's opening episode sets up two themes that run through the rest of the season. One is of double identity, where people aren't who they seem and those projecting the most confidence are often on the most uncertain ground. This lends the show an unsettling quality, where those in charge, such as Tramell Tillman's Milchick (the supervisor) or manager Harmony Corbell (played by Patricia Arquette),  

 The second is some kind of theme around identity and a right to self-determination.
