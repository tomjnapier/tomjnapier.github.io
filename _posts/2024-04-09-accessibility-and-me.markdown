I was beginning to find my feet little, a couple of years into my first front-end developer job. 

It was for a great design agency in Sheffield, with some really supportive directors. They were open to me and a colleague doing a bit of networking and horizon-expanding, and so we found ourselves attending Front End North, a developer conference hosted in Sheffield.

This was back in 2016 and my memory of it is a little hazy, but I can be sure that there were talks from devs at the Financial Times, a senior designer from Automattic (the company behind WordPress) and someone from Government Digital Service.

Front End North was my first significant conference, and the talks were transformative for me as a relatively inexperience devloper. I can't say a lot of the specifics have stuck with me, although they were definitely useful at the time. There was one line though, from the Government Digital Service talk, that stuck with me, and I recounted it as part of my job application for the civil service seven years later. That line was that "government has a mandate to serve all".

## This is for everyone

I was utterly inspired by this notion. The stuff government was creating need to work for everyone. If it didn't, which users are you excluding, and why? I started thinking about my own work and improving the standards of the interfaces I was developing. 

I became increasingly obsessed with writing code to a high standard. This jarred with the economic pressures and ever-ticking clock of private sector work.

## The next chapter

COVID was tough to get through. I worked the whole way through, in my attic, sharing a tiny desk with my Architect partner. I think we both found work especially challenging and isolating during this time. I eventually resolved to leave my job. I needed a break from the rigours of client work and started to think about the public sector.

I found an interesting looking job in the civil service as an accessibility specialist. The role required a solid understanding of HTML and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I'd definitely got the former, and for several years had been increasingly honing my knowledge of the latter. I got the job after a written application, technical exercise and an interview. A few weeks later I left work on a Friday as a front end web developer and started work on a Monday as an accessibility specialist (In hindsight, I would strongly advise anyone considering such a move to have more than a weekend between career changes).

## Reflection

I have few real barriers in my life. I'm a bit short and can't reach things in the supermarket sometimes, but that's pretty much my biggest complaint. 

In a presentation recently someone shared the wheel of power/privilege. I think it's important to be sceptical about some ideas of privilege (the term can be used quite lazily sometimes), but nevertheless, I was a little taken aback, realising that I identify with almost all of the characteristics closer to the power part of the wheel, rather than marginalised (everything except rich, but I'd argue, having visited some poorer regions of the world, that even that's all a matter of perspective).

It's perhaps atypical for someone to enter the accessibility profession without a deep connection to accessibility already. But I reflect now that my passion has clearly always lied with standards, inclusivity, and a democratic access to government support. My lived experience isn't necessarily one where I feel excluded, by that doesn't mean I don't care deeply about those who are.

I think this makes for a solid foundation, for me to build a career in digital accessibility. Let's see where it takes me.
