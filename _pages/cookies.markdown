I don't track visits on this site. I don't use Google Analytics or other tracking services. 

If you want to double check, open up [devTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in your browser and find the 'storage' section (in Chrome and Edge, that's under Applications, in Safari and Firefox, 'storage' it's own tab) and then 'cookies'.

There is one thing that gets stored on your device - that's the setting for the site theme (whether you like dark mode, light mode, or whatever matches your system). You can clear this at any time by clearing your browsing data. But don't do that, because it'll likely clear all your browsing data and log you out of your favourite websites. A better way to do this is again, open devTools, go to 'Application' and under 'storage' you should be able to 'Clear site data'.
