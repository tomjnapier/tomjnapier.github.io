Hey, I'm Tom, a front-end web developer and accessibility specialist. I'm currently with the civil service.

Over the years I've worked on hundreds of front-end dev projects for lots of different types of people and organisations, from small businesses and local charities, to publicly listed companies and national organisations.

I love working on sites with long form text, like magazines or journals. I feel quite engaged with the web's democratising power, so even though almost no-one will ever get to this site, nevermind read its contents I think it's important for me to have this space anyway. This is my bit of the web and I'm claiming it!

I spend some of my time watching movies, playing video games and vaguely following this year's Formula 1 season.

Away from the screen, I have interests in road cycling, climbing and swimming.
