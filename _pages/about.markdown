Hey, I'm Tom, a front-end web developer and accessibility specialist. I'm currently employed in the civil service.

## Me and the web
Throughout the mid-2010's, I became really invested in principle that the web is for everyone. I admired many of the principles being espoused by digital teams in UK Government, who spoke passionately about having a "mandate to serve everyone". I held Government Digital Service in the highest regard, but never thought I'd be working in Government. Fast-forward to 2023 and I'm working with fantastic people in Government every day, helping them develop digital services that are accesible.

I read Tim Berners-Lee's book on the creation of the web recently, and I feel quite engaged with the notion that we can all be content creators and information sharers. So even though almost no-one will ever get to this site (nevermind read its contents!) I think it's important for me to have this space anyway. This is my bit of the web and I'm claiming it!

## Design work
Over the years I've worked on hundreds of front-end dev projects for lots of different types of people and organisations, from small businesses and local charities, to publicly listed companies and national organisations.

I'd described myself as a frontend developer, but I'm probably happiest designing interfaces and solving problems. I love working on sites with long form text, like magazines or journals.

## What else?
I spend some of my time watching movies, playing video games and vaguely following this year's Formula 1 season.

Away from the screen, I have interests in road cycling, climbing and swimming.
